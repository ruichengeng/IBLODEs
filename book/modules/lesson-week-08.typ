// Have students work on the complex number appendix before this week

// We take the linear combination approach, not the real/imag part approach to finding real solutions.

== AI Draft

=== Before the week

Assign the _Complex Numbers_ appendix ahead of time. Students need complex arithmetic and Euler's formula to be
_recall_, not discovery, or the week collapses. Almost none of them will have seen Euler's formula
recently.

=== The arc

A new model (fleas and dogs) is built from premises, turned into affine form, and re-centred into a
matrix system---all of which is now routine. What is new is that the eigenvalues come out complex.

The three "general solution" exercises function as *one very long question*. Plan them as a unit and
protect the time.

=== Real solutions from complex ones

We deliberately do *not* use the textbook trick of taking real and imaginary parts of a complex
solution. Instead, students form the specific linear combinations $arrow(s)_1 + arrow(s)_2$ and
$i (arrow(s)_1 - arrow(s)_2)$ and expand with Euler's formula.

The trick is easier to memorize; the linear combinations are what we want students to understand.
Every real solution we can build is a linear combination of the solutions we already have, and that
idea carries forward. If a student asks whether those two combinations always work, the answer is
"yes, unless the equation itself has complex coefficients"; the general recipe is to solve for
constants $alpha, beta$ making $alpha arrow(s)_1 + beta arrow(s)_2$ real.

Practical notes:

- The expansions take a long time. Do *one* of them on the board and no more; don't wait for the
  whole class to finish the algebra before moving to discussion.
- Complex eigenvectors are where students slow to a crawl. Consider announcing partway through that
  they may use a computer---but then say explicitly what your test expectations are, because a
  computer will hand them a different (equally correct) eigenvector than the one the next exercise
  uses.
- Verifying a solution is real can be done geometrically: plot it on top of the phase portrait in
  Desmos as a parametric curve. Essentially no student will think of this. Show them.
- Two linearly independent eigen solutions is enough. Don't enumerate all of them.

=== Landing the week

Wrap up with the whole process written out: affine $arrow$ matrix, find a basis of eigen solutions,
combine complex ones into real ones, translate back to the affine equation. The commentary that
matters is that the matrix equation has *no* real eigen solutions at all---complex numbers are what
let us keep using eigen methods---but that only the real solutions mean anything about fleas and
dogs.

The shampoo exercise then derives the stability classification for complex eigenvalues. This part
needs some lecturing: name the eigenvectors $arrow(v)_1, arrow(v)_2$ rather than computing them, and
study the $e^(lambda t)$ factors. Tell students whether you expect them to reproduce this derivation
on a test. The final practice exercise *can be skipped*.

=== How other texts frame this

Every other text takes real and imaginary parts. Worth knowing, though, that the "trick" is not
really a trick anywhere: it is the _summary_ of our argument. Zill derives his real solutions by
forming exactly our two combinations---$1/2 (arrow(s)_1 + arrow(s)_2)$ and
$(i slash 2)(-arrow(s)_1 + arrow(s)_2)$---expanding with Euler's formula, and only then observing
that the results are $"Re"(arrow(v))$ and $"Im"(arrow(v))$ and stating that as the theorem students
use. Blanchard proves the real/imaginary-parts theorem from linearity. So we are stopping one step
short of where the standard texts stop, and keeping the reasoning as the method.

That is a useful thing to tell the class at the wrap-up: the rule they will meet in other books is
a shortcut for what they just did, and now they know why it works.

Blanchard also has the cleanest one-line motivation for the whole week, if the class asks why
complex numbers have to appear at all: "We cannot use the geometric ideas of the previous sections
to find solution curves that are straight lines *because there aren't any straight-line
solutions*."
